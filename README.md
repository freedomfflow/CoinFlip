# CoinFlip
My initial Solidity Dapp using an Oracle

This is a simple betting app where a button click will simulate a coin flip.  The wagering and payouts will be done
on an Ethereum blockchain testnet.

The application will utilize external randomness via an Oracle service to get true randomness for governing the coin flip.
